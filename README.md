# ChessVision

Chess Vision is a project that aims to build a chessboard recognition framework capable of detecting a chessboard and classifying pieces on an edge device (Jetson Nano). The framework will utilize deep learning models, optimized with various techniques, to achieve high accuracy and low latency. Key features include real-time analysis, smooth visuals, and optimal resource utilization. The project will be implemented using CUDA, OpenCV, cuDNN, and TensorRT.
